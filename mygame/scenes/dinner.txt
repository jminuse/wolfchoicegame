She walks straight past the hostess, who chases after her fretfully like a poodle until stopped with a sharp look from the waiter. She sits down at a corner table by the window, slightly separated from the others. You sit down too. The waiter brings a bottle to the table that looks like it was pulled from the wreckage of a French chateau in 1940 and saved for a special occasion. He shows her the label, uncorks, and pours for both of you. Do you even drink alcohol?

    *goto welcome
  #No
    You politely refuse. She gives the barest hint of a frown but otherwise doesn't seem to mind.
    *goto welcome
  #No, but I can pretend
