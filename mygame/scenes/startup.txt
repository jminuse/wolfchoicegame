You are early for work

You see some weird stuff (bloodstains, scratch marks)

Question, for flavor

It's your first day as an analyst at Goldman Sachs. You notice that the other analysts are all surprisingly muscular in their tailored suits, and also are somewhat excessively hairy. Soon lunch comes around and you notice one of the other more senior analysts motion you over.

"Care to join me for lunch?" she says with a wide smile.

You see no reason why not.
